# DEFINE PROBLEM
DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, and is the basic material that makes
up human chromosomes. DNA microarrays measure the expression of a gene in a cell by measuring the amount of mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) present for that gene.

How does a DNA microarray work? The nucleotide sequences for a few thousand geens are printed on a glass slide. A target sample and a reference
sample are labeled with red and green dyes, and each are hybridized with
the DNA on the slide. Through fluoroscopy, the log (red/green) intensities
of RNA hybridizing at each site is measured. The result is a few thousand
numbers, typically ranging from say âˆ’6 to 6, measuring the expression level
of each gene in the target relative to the reference sample.
